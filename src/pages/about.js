        <p>
          Blathadex is a field guide to island life created for people serious
          about "catchin them critters". Through the use of the tool users can
          mark critters as caught and find more information about critters that
          are available. In the details section of each creature the user can
          find information about where and when is the optimal time to catch the
          criter.

        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
          We have enjoyed the game so much that we decided to pair up and take
          advantage of quarantine quality time to produce Blathadex. As a
          developer and designer we hope this will be the first of many apps we
          will build to share with the world.
