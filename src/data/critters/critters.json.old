They do lose teeth regularly through biting-related activities, but, luckily, those teeth grow back quickly. In fact, their missing teeth can be regrown in a single day. Just imagine their tooth-fairy-related income!"

Unlike many of their kin in the shark family, whale sharks are nonviolent, eating only plankton and such. They grow slowly and live long, relaxed lives of filter feeding and leisure in warm waters. So if you ever have to choose a fish as a roommate, you could do worse than the whale shark. Unless you can't swim."
