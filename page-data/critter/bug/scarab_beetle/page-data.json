They're so shiny that they're said to gleam like gold. They're very rare and can be sold for high prices. Like all beetles in the scarab family, the outer shell provides a very thick layer of protection from predators. The high value and golden shell do make them more vulnerable when it comes to Bell hunters, though."}}}}
