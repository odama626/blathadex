They swim in shallow areas in rivers and mostly eat bugs that float on the surface of the water. This is why they have mouths as high up their faces as their eyes, making them effective hunters. Being the same temperature as the water they inhabit, getting grabbed by warm hands can shock them.","rarity":"uncommon","quote":"I caught a killifish!

The reason for this strange habitat is that crawfish are plentiful and will eat just about anything. Eating plant material makes their bodies red, but only eating fish and meat will turn their bodies blue. A red color indicates they are eating a healthy and balanced diet, so red is the ideal for the species.","rarity":"common","quote":"I caught a crawfish!

They dwell on land, so they have lungs and skin as opposed to a set of gills. They like to stick close to water because they require a nice, moist lifestyle. Frogs are moist because they emit a liquid to protect their skin from dryness. If too much moisture evaporates from their thin skins, they could have trouble breathing. It's better not to handle frogs, as some species are poisonous, even to the touch!","rarity":"common","quote":null},{"bells":800,"name":"Catfish","no":17,"id":"a3a36a3c-dbdd-5e83-9528-8294a88581e1","etime":9,"etime2":null,"smonth":5,"smonth2":null,"stime":16,"stime2":null,"type":"fish","size":"29,20 in. 70 cm","loc":"Pond","emonth2":null,"emonth":10,"desc":"Catfish are known for their long whiskers, wide bodies, and large mouths, but they don't have fur. Despite having large eyes, they have rather poor eyesight. They make up for this with sensory whiskers. Catfish have small horizontal and vertical lines in their bodies, almost like perforated lines. These holes are for detecting weak electric currents of other fish, making them adept hunters. Catfish are artful carnivores as they swim around lazily but then strike quickly when prey is found.","rarity":"fairly common","quote":null},{"bells":5500,"name":"Giant Snakehead","no":18,"id":"9469835c-2da4-5866-abf7-7118fe427ef0","etime":null,"etime2":null,"smonth":6,"smonth2":null,"stime":null,"stime2":null,"type":"fish","size":"27.45 in. 85 cm","loc":"Pond","emonth2":null,"emonth":8,"desc":"Giant snakeheads get their name from the fact that their heads look like those of snakes.
