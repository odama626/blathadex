Only the females feed on blood, and when they do so, they also inject saliva. The saliva is actually what causes the annoying itchy feeling, rather than the bite itself. Mosquitoes detect body heat, sweat, and carbon dioxide, so they are drawn to exercising humans.","rarity":"fairly common","quote":null}}}}
