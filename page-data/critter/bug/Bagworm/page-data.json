The filthy fraud uses silk and leaves to spin a cozy bag for it to hide inside - hence the name. Some find it cute the way bagworms dangle from trees. But the truth is they're gluttonous monsters. These beasts love to stuff their bug-gullets full of leaves, devouring the very trees they hang upon. (Wretched villains is what they are.)","rarity":"uncommon","quote":"I caught a bagworm!
