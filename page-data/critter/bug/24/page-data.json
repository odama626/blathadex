Allow me to share a fact with you! Wasps are sometimes called \"meat bees\" because... They. Eat. MEAT! MEAT! Of almost any sort! Surely you've seen what a menace they make of themselves at picnics.

Aggressive predators with venomous stingers, wasps not only hunt and eat other insects...they paralyze their prey, then drag their victims home ALIVE, leaving them for their larva to feed upon. Suddenly a simple sting seems quite tolerable."}}}}
