Their horns are actually part of their exoskeleton. Horned dynastids don't have a nose or ears, but they can sense smells with their antennae. They are also able to feel the minor vibrations of sounds traveling in the air using thin hair on their bodies. They are fairly loud when flying, plus they emit a rather sour odor, so they are hard not to notice.","rarity":"uncommon","quote":null}}}}
