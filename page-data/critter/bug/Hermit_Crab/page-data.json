Though it most certainly resembles one. Blech! It looks much like a spider- what with its creepy eyes and crawly legs- but is, in fact, a crustacean. As such, the hermit crab has 10 legs and also wears a shell. But it doesn't grow this shell itself. It slips its soft body into shells left behind by snails, you see, and moves into ever-larger ones as it grows. (Talk about a strange way to make a home.)","rarity":"scarce","quote":"I caught a hermit crab! I think it wanted to be left alone!"}}}}
