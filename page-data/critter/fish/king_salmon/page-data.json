This size essentially makes them the actual kings of salmon, though they are also called chinook salmon. In some regions, they return to the river in spring or summer and live there until spawning in the fall. In rare cases, king salmons' meat will be white, but these are not as popular since pink is the standard.","rarity":"scarce","quote":"Yes! I caught a King salmon! Checkmate!"}}}}
