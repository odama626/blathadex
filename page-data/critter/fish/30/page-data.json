In Japan, flavored salmon eggs are a very popular dish called ikura, but it hasn't caught on in the US. In rare cases, salmon will only stay in the ocean for one or two years before coming back. These fish are known as \"phantom salmon\" since they're so hard to find in the wild. Their characteristic pink color comes from the shrimp and krill they get in their diet. If they ate differently, their flesh would be white. Salmon only spawn at the bottom of the waterfall where the lake meets the ocean."}}}}
