They've been around for over 100 million years, making them rather ancient fish as well. They breathe through gills but also with an air bladder used by poking their mouths above water. They have hard, coarse tongues that are used to break down the smaller fish they eat.","rarity":"rare","quote":"I caught an arapaima! How did it get here? Arapaiknow!"}}}}
