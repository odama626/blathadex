They are known for their large scales and the hair that sticks out from their lower lips. They have a remarkable jumping ability and can leap over a yard above the surface of the water. Males protect their babies by keeping them in their mouths and releasing them once they reach a certain size.","rarity":"rare","quote":"I caught an arowana! I'd make a joke, but I don't 'wana."}}}}
