If viewed from below, rays appear to have their mouths curled up into a sort of smile. Some varieties have poisonous spikes at the base of their long tail fins that can be fatal to humans. This, combined with the ability to hide in sand at the bottom of the sea, can make them very dangerous.","rarity":"scarce","quote":"I caught a ray! A few more and I'll have a tan!"}}}}
