They are popular fish that have been bred to have beautiful flowing tail fins. Mother guppies give birth to their babies after the eggs hatch in their bellies. They give birth at a rate that's nearly constant, so their population tends to grow rather quickly.","rarity":"scarce","quote":"I caught a guppy! Welcome to the team, newbie!"}}}}
