Although their shy, gentle fish, surprisingly they're related to piranha, though very distantly. They have very sharp and narrow teeth, an odd contrast to their beauty. They are delicate fish who tend to be very sensitive to the cleanliness and temperature of water.","rarity":"uncommon","quote":"I caught a neon tetra! Wasn't hard to track."}}}}
