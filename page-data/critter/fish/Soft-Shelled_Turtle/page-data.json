In addition to its powerful bite, this little critter has the ability to breathe both above and below water! It has an unusually long neck which it uses for both breathing and biting. Come to think of it, how did you manage to avoid being bitten? Well, it's a fearsome critter, but just look at that face! Rather silly, wot?","rarity":"scarce","quote":"I caught a soft-shelled turtle! It's more sensitive than other turtles."}}}}
