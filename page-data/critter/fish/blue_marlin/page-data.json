Unlike normally slim and sleek mackerels, giant trevallys have wide, sliver bodies. Surprisingly, though, these fish cannot tolerate the cold, so they tend to live in warmer places. Their jaw strength is great enough to bite off a person's finger, so be very careful when fishing for them!","rarity":"scarce","quote":null}]}}}
