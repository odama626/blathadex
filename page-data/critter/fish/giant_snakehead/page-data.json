Their scales and patterns also look like snakes', really bringing the resemblance to a high degree. They have sharp teeth, so don't poke your finger anywhere near their mouths! Both males and females are well known for protecting their eggs and offspring. They will scare off any other fish that approach by frantically waving their tails."}}}}
