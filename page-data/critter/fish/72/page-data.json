However, despite being sharks, they are actually fairly laid back, which is not what you'd expect. With their eyes positioned on the two ends of their \"hammer,\" they can see in almost all directions. Oddly, their nose holes are located right next to their eyes on their hammer section. They have a number of small holes on the front and lower portions of their heads as well. These holes allow them to detect prey, even fish hiding below them and out of sight. While they eat a nice array of fish, it seems that rays are their favorite source of food. Rays, beware!"}}}}
