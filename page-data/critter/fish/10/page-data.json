The reason for this strange habitat is that crawfish are plentiful and will eat just about anything. Eating plant material makes their bodies red, but only eating fish and meat will turn their bodies blue. A red color indicates they are eating a healthy and balanced diet, so red is the ideal for the species."}}}}
