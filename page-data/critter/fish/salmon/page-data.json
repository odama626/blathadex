These fish are known as \"phantom salmon\" since they're so hard to find in the wild. Their characteristic pink color comes from the shrimp and krill they get in their diet.

No one knows why they do it, but I like to think it's their impression of bread popping out of toaster!","rarity":"scarce","quote":"I caught a sturgeon! Wonder if it can perform sturgery..."}]}}}
