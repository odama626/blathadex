They get their name from their bright, vivid color, in addition to the length of their bodies. Ribbon eels hatch sexless before first becoming males, then females as they age. Their tendency to stick their heads out from holes in the sand and open their mouths is not a sign of anger. In actuality, they're merely taking a breath. Oddly, they're surprisingly peaceful creatures, despite the look.","rarity":"uncommon","quote":null}}}}
