Do you know how to tell the difference between a crucian carp and a standard-issue carp? It's quite easy to tell the two apart... One must simply locate the barbels. Or, rather, the lack of them! And just what is a barbel, you ask? Well, a barbel looks a little something like a mustache. A run-of-the-mill carp will sport this unsightly \"facial hair,\" while a crucian carp is considerably better groomed! I tried to grow a mustache when I was younger. It never did fill in quite right... All for the best in the end, as mustaches go so much better with noses than with beaks!"}}}}
