They dwell on land, so they have lungs and skin as opposed to a set of gills. They like to stick close to water because they require a nice, moist lifestyle. Frogs are moist because they emit a liquid to protect their skin from dryness. If too much moisture evaporates from their thin skins, they could have trouble breathing. It's better not to handle frogs, as some species are poisonous, even to the touch!"}}}}
