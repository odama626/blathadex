Blowfish are not poisonous at birth, though, which makes young ones relatively safe for consumption. It's only once they have ingested enough microbes from seawater and food that they become poisonous. When they feel threatened, they suck in air and water to blow themselves up like balloons. This makes them too big to eat without predators being horsed to chomp down on their poison quills."}}}}
