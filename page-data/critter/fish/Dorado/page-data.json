As the name would indicate, these fish are gold and have black dots. They look like salmon but are very toothy, carnivorous, and related to piranha. They're such ferocious fish that other fish regularly flee from them, fearful of becoming a snack. Their ferocious natures and power make them a prize catch among anglers.","rarity":"rare","quote":null}}}}
