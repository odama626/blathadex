The true name comes from the distinctive humps on their heads. But \"Napoleonfish\" is more popular. When small, all Napoleonfish are females, but some become males as they age and their humps grow. Their bodies also turn a bluer shade as they mature and become males, making identification simple. Their bulky bodies, which can get to about six feet long, still glide easily through warm tropical seas. Finding these fish is a real treat for divers, as they're stunning to see - and it's a great story to tell."}}}}
