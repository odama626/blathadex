Despite having large eyes, they have rather poor eyesight. They make up for this with sensory whiskers. Catfish have small horizontal and vertical lines in their bodies, almost like perforated lines. These holes are for detecting weak electric currents of other fish, making them adept hunters. Catfish are artful carnivores as they swim around lazily but then strike quickly when prey is found.","rarity":"fairly common","quote":null}}}}
