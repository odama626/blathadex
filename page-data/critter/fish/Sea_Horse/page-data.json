They use their small dorsal fins and tail fins to swim, but in actuality they're pretty bad swimmers. They wrap their tail fins around seaweed or coral so they won't float away with the current. Once attached, they feed on plankton and small shrimp that float by. The female deposits eggs in the male's pouch, putting the burden of child care on the male.","rarity":"fairly common","quote":"I caught a sea horse! But...where's its sea jockey?"}}}}
