Their homes may be dangerous, but they produce a special coating that protects them from the poison. In exchange for the anemone's protection, the clown fish chases off any parasitic bugs and enemies. Curiously, all clown fish are males when they're young but change into females if necessity demands.","rarity":"uncommon","quote":"I caught a clown fish! How many can fit in a carfish?"}}}}
