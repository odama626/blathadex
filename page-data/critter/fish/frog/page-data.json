They dwell on land, so they have lungs and skin as opposed to a set of gills. They like to stick close to water because they require a nice, moist lifestyle. Frogs are moist because they emit a liquid to protect their skin from dryness. If too much moisture evaporates from their thin skins, they could have trouble breathing.
